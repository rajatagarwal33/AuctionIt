## Proposal: Dynamic Auction Website

We propose the development of a **dynamic auction platform** using the **MERN stack**:

- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**

Optional integration with **Firebase** was explored where applicable.

The goal of the platform is to provide a **secure, interactive, and real-time auction experience**, supporting modern web application features such as authentication, real-time updates, and user-specific functionality.
