# Dynamic Auction Website Proposal

## Overview
We propose the development of a dynamic auction website leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with possible Firebase integration. Our platform aims to provide a secure auction experience, incorporating possible features such as role-based access control, real-time bidding, geolocation-based search filters, real-time communication, and a notification system.

## Possible Features
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implement RBAC to ensure that users, including buyers and sellers, have access only to the functionalities and data relevant to their role. Admins will have the authority to manage user roles and permissions effectively.

### Real-Time Bidding
Enable real-time bidding functionality to allow users to place and view bids instantly, enhancing the competitiveness of auctions and user engagement.

### Real-Time Communication
Facilitate real-time communication between users and owners/sellers to streamline inquiries, negotiations, and transaction details.

### Notification System
Implement a notification system to alert users about relevant updates, such as new bids, messages, or listings matching their preferences, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

### Geolocation-Based Search Filters  (tentative)
Utilize geolocation data to enable users to filter listings based on their proximity, ensuring that users can discover items relevant to their location easily.
